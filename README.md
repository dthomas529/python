# Hi, I’m @dthomas529.

- 👀 I’m interested in developing web apps, Saas, and plugins.

- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself Python by reading "Sams Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours" and "Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours." I also use Replit.com and Learn Python, a mobile app, to practice writing code.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would benefit from my help and help me improve my understanding and proficiency of programming and acquire other tech skills.

- 📫 If you think I might be a good fit, please contact me at dthomas529@gmail.com.
